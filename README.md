## As-har Dweedar

Create a React Native App or a React JS website uses Firebase for Database and Authentication, it will be used for food recipese where the Main Page is a registration page (Using Firebase auth either Email & Password Auth or Social Auth) Home Page shows recipese and the user can open the recipes on a Recipe Page and add comments or add the recipese to his/her favorites, make a page for recommendations where itâ€™s more like a todo list where users can add names for recommended recipes to add to the app and the names just stake under each other there.

Use React Native or React JS, most use Redux & Firebase.

Make the code clean, simple and non repeatable.

For Firebase database use any simple data you create just 2 to 5 recipes.

user => email , pass, name , fav , recipese, 
recipese => comments, creator, ingrediants, name, preparing, time
